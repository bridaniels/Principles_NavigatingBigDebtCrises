# US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2001)

## Emerging Bubble: 2004-2006

### Early and Healthy Start of Debt Cycle: 
- Debt Grows in Line with Income Growth 
- Debt Used to Finance Activities Growing Income 
- Debt-to-GDP Ratio: Roughly Measures Balance 
    - 1990s Debt-to-GDP Ratio Increased Slightly (period of strong income growth and low unemployment)
    - 2001 Recession (Tightened Monetary Policy, dot-com bubble, 9/11 shock -> Fed Lower IR down to 1%)

### Goldilocks Period: 
- Economy Strong
- Inflation Moderate
- Appreciating Asset Prices 

### Interest Rate Movements: 
- Federal Reserve focuses on **Growth, Inflation, and GDP Gap** (more than debt growth - don't regulate bubbles)
    - Don't worry about debt-financed asset growth 
    - Debt Bubbles Usually Grow in One or More Individual Markets (easy to average out) 
- Increased IR from lows of 1% to just over 5% in 2006 
- Not enough to slow debt financed asset appreciation
