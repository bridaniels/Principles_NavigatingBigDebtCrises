## Problems with Subprime Mortgages
- Investment banks packaging and securitizing assets for sale. (CDOs, synthetic CDOs, CMOs, etc.)
    - rating best slice AAA, the next slice AA, ....
    - AAA-rated bond yielding slightly higher than other AAA bonds
    - Hedge funds taking bottom slice offering leverage and volatility 
    - Offered credit to risky borrowers 
- Lowered lending standards led to an uptick in delinquencies 
    - banks stoped buying loans 
    - originators stuck with losses 
> #### "Early Payment Defaults"
> - Provision within agreement with investment bank buying subprime loan
> - If borrower misses one of the first few payments -> lender must buy back the loan 
>   - Typically very rare for the borrower to miss a payment 

- New Century: 2nd Largest Subprime Lender in 2006 
    - 2.5% of borrowers failed to make initial payments 
    - did not have cash to cover buy-backs 
    - **filed for bankruptcy in April 2007**

## Self-Reinforcing Debt Crisis: 
---
- [Mark-to-Market Accounting](x_definitions.md#mark-to-market-accounting) + High Leverage 
    - assets bought via leverage have declining value 
    - weaker asset prices = less avaliable lending
    - values + losses on positions estimated via pricing of various liquid assets 
    - financial sector was incurring loses before they reported them 
    - *many fancing debt squeezes*
- Losses Occur -> Lenders+Borrowers are less able to Lend and Borrow

> - Financial fragility coming from leveraging and lending practices 
>    - IR will rise until the system breaks 
>    - BREAKS: high volatility + wide carry and credit spreads 
> #### **`Results = f(who is carrying what positions) + f(positions vs. various players)`**
> - Bridgewater Exposure Study with Derivative Focus: 
>   - revealed that no one was truly aware of their full exposure across markets
>   - larger more regulated parties had easier to assess exposure 
>   - *With Derivatives*, dealers know thier counterparties but are not aware of other deals the counterparty has on their books.

## Unraveling in Interbank Market 
---
- TED Spread (classic measure of interbank stress): Higher Rate = Banks Demanding Higher IR to Compensate for Lending Risk

# Why Banks and Investors So Exposed to Risky Mortgage Securities: 
---
#### Thought Mortgage Securities Were Less Risky Than They actualy Were 
#### Way Risk is Analyzed: 
- Value at Risk (VAR): 
    - commonly used by investment firms and commercial banks
    - help determine magnitude and occurrence of potential losses 
    - typically uses recent volatility as the main input
    - determine how much risk (position size) one can take 
- Recent volatility had been low and investors were assuming the good conditions would continue 
- Boring Years Sow Seeds of Future Instability 
- Low VAR encourages Increased Leverage 
- Leverage is a Better Estimation of Future Volatility 
- Subprime Mortgage Instruments had not yeat had a loss cycle or experienced much volatility in the past 
- **VAR self-reinforcing on the downside**
    - increased market volatility make riskiness look even worse -> increasing selling
