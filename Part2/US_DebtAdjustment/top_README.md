## Problems with Subprime Mortgages
- Investment banks packaging and securitizing assets for sale. (CDOs, synthetic CDOs, CMOs, etc.)
    - rating best slice AAA, the next slice AA, ....
    - AAA-rated bond yielding slightly higher than other AAA bonds
    - Hedge funds taking bottom slice offering leverage and volatility 
    - Offered credit to risky borrowers 
- Lowered lending standards led to an uptick in delinquencies 
    - banks stoped buying loans 
    - originators stuck with losses 
> #### "Early Payment Defaults"
> - Provision within agreement with investment bank buying subprime loan
> - If borrower misses one of the first few payments -> lender must buy back the loan 
>   - Typically very rare for the borrower to miss a payment 

- New Century: 2nd Largest Subprime Lender in 2006 
    - 2.5% of borrowers failed to make initial payments 
    - did not have cash to cover buy-backs 
    - **filed for bankruptcy in April 2007**

## Self-Reinforcing Debt Crisis: 
---
- [Mark-to-Market Accounting](x_definitions.md#mark-to-market-accounting) + High Leverage 
    - assets bought via leverage have declining value 
    - weaker asset prices = less avaliable lending
    - values + losses on positions estimated via pricing of various liquid assets 
    - financial sector was incurring loses before they reported them 
    - *many fancing debt squeezes*
- Losses Occur -> Lenders+Borrowers are less able to Lend and Borrow
