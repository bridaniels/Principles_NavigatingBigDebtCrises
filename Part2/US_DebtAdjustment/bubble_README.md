# Emerging Bubble: 2004-2006
---

> ## Classic Bubble Characteristics: 
> 1. **Prices High** relative to traditional measures
>     - flipping houses 
> 2. Prices **Discounting Future Rapid Price Appreciation** from high levels
> 3. **Broad Bullish Sentiment**
>     - *Time* magazine cover "Will Your House Make You Rich?"
> 4. **High Leverage** Purchases 
>     - Leveraging up betting on prices continuing to increase 
> 5. Buyers with **Extended Forward Purchases** to speculate/hedge future price gains
>     - homebuilders stocking up supplies 
>     - supplies increasing as high prices encouraged production 
> 6. **New Entrants**
>     - new single family homes doubled between 1995-2005
> 7. **Stimulative Monetary Policy** to help inflate the bubble (tight pops)
- Logic (opposite tends to happen in bubbles): 
    - Betting on price changes? -> Deleverage or Sell
    - Lenders become more cautious 
- Everybody wanted to buy a house or lend to someone looking to buy a house

## Leading up to the Bubble: 
---

### Early and Healthy Start of Debt Cycle "Goldilocks Period":
- **Economy Strong, Income Moderate, Appreciating Asset Prices** 
- Debt Grows in Line with Income Growth 
- Debt Used to Finance Activities Growing Income 
- Debt-to-GDP Ratio: Roughly Measures Balance 
    - 1990s Debt-to-GDP Ratio Increased Slightly (period of strong income growth and low unemployment)
    - 2001 Recession (Tightened Monetary Policy, dot-com bubble, 9/11 shock -> Fed Lower IR down to 1%)


### Interest Rate Movements: 
- Federal Reserve focuses on **Growth, Inflation, and GDP Gap** (more than debt growth - don't regulate bubbles)
    - Don't worry about debt-financed asset growth 
    - Debt Bubbles Usually Grow in One or More Individual Markets (easy to average out) 
- Increased IR from lows of 1% to just over 5% in 2006 
- Not enough to slow debt financed asset appreciation 

## Housing Market Debt Bubble: 
---
> #### 2004-2006: Home Prices Increased ~30%
> #### 2000-2006: Home Prices Increased ~80%
> #### Price rise clasically self-reinforcing in ways that create bubbles
> #### Most houses bought with borrowed money (Mortgages)
> - Home price gains have magnified impacts on equity values  
> - Home value increases -> allow individual to borrow against their home equity 
- Bubble Peak: ~8% of Households Buying a Home Each Year
#### Household Debt Rose from 85% of Disposable Income in 2000 to 120% in 2006
- Biggest increases in debt amongst lowest income earners 
- Lowered credit standards made it easier for people to borrow against their home equity 
- Home equity loans and cash-out refinancing totaled ~$500 billion in 2005
    - 5x from 1998
    - pushed overall US debt to over 300% GDP
#### More Home Prices Went Up -> More Credit Standards Lowered 
- Profitable for both lenders and borrowers 
- Credit-fueled buying drove prices higher (self-reinforcing)
- Leveraging Up took off in 2003-2007 
- Banks not asking for proof of income before writing mortgage 
    - Pushing adjustable rate mortgages (enticing borrowers with low "teaser" rates before rates increased later)
    - Subprime Mortgages (riskier): 20% of the market 
    - Mortgage Risk Packaged to Obscure Underlying Risks ("Securitization")
        - Allowed for more avaliable credit + low interest rates 
#### Fed's Easy Monetary Policy: 
- Mortgage rates dropped to lows in 2003 (not seen since 1950s) 
    - stayed near lows well into bubble
- Rates rose ~1.5% in 2005-2007 (Still High Leveraging Up)(begain raising in 2004)
    - LT nominal IR roughly flat while LT real IR declined 
- Bubble formed via asset price inflation via debt growth (Fed focuses on CPI inflation)
- Inflation on the high end of normal at avg. 2-3.5%
- Short term IR below inflation rate (negative short term borrowing costs 2000-2006)
- **Noted excess in subprime market**

#### Issues within Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
- Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson gets President Bush's support in fall of 2006 to pass legislation for reforms 
- Nothing happened till 2008

## Emerging Broader-Based Bubble 
--- 
### Low Interest Rates + Easy Money + Lax Regulations + Risky Financial Innovations
### Broader Economy Bubble Signs 
- savings rates declined 
- increase in foreign capital inflows
- lowering global export market share to emerging countries (especially China)
- manufacturing employment falls 
#### Housing Market Camouflaged 
- increase in construction employment 
#### High Debt Growth -> Funding Consumption 
- via mortgages and other debt instruments
- debt not being used to grow income (aka using for investment)
- US citizens using debt to consume more than they earn 
> ### Unsustainable Dynamic: 
> - Savings Cannot Fall Forever
> - Lending Cannot Increase Forever 
> #### Debts Due = Cash Flow Problems 

### *"Shadow Banking"* = New Instruments Outside of Regulation 
- higher risk lending increasing -> common for bubbles 
- new instruments to get around more established ones with fewer regulations (thus cheaper and easier)
- appear safe via garuntees or sales tactics 
- *traditional regulated banking system backed by the* **FDIC's Systemic Risk Exemption** *allowing them to do more to step in and help*

> ### 5 Key Components Fueling Leverage Outside the Traditional Bankig System 
> #### Mostly Short-Term and Unregulated 
> 1. **Repo Agreements + Commercial Paper**
>       - short-term borrowing for banks and corporations 
> 2. **Large Institutional Depositors Outside Protected Banking System**
>       - Treasury Security Demand > Supply 
>       - shortage of safe assets for investors 
>       - *SUBS: asset-backed commercial paper + repo 
> 3. **Money Market Funds (MMF) developed**
>       - short-term savings with higher returns (than traditional bank acounts)
>       - low additional risk 
> 4. **Dollar Lending Globalization**
>       - increase in dollar borrowing/lending in foreign markets 
> 5. **Securitization of Lending**
>       - banks able to sell loan portfolios to other investors 
>       - *"Moral Hazard"* by banks increased incentive to make riskier loans 

### Asset/Liability Missmatches 
1. Borrowing ST and Lending LT 
    - squeezed when ST lender stops lending or lends at higher IR 
2. Lending to Risky Borrowers at Higher IR than They Borrowed for Credit Spread 
    - until default rates pick up to a level greater than the credit spread 
3. Borrowing in One Currency and Lending/Investing in another 
    - borrowed currency rises -> pay back loan at a higher exchange rate/interest rate
