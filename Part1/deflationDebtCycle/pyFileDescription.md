# **d_cycle.PY File Description**

# RANGE(start, end, frequency):
### FINISHED BOUNDARIES 
- bubble_range() 
    - bubble parameters 
##### TBD 
- top_range()
    - bubble_end already found
    - just need to find start of phase 3
- phase_4_range()
    - cut out `top_range()` to find boundaries here 
    - simplified? 
- phase_5_range()
    - same as top_range() -> maybe cut this out to make it run faster 
- phase_6_range()
    - both boundaries needed 
- phase_7_range()
    - end of cycle
    - do you need anything? 
    - determine start of next cycle? 
    - when does this end 
- all_cycle_ranges()
    - bubbles done 
    - put each boundary into list to use as references/lines for other functions 
    - dictionary? 
        - have `key()` be the boundary name? 


### FINISHED LISTS
- list_gdi_debt()
    - used to calculate bubble boundaries 
- list_to_url()
    - random added -> not needed (default to False)



# PLOTTING(frequency, start, end, cycle_lines=None)
### Finished
- everything from the foundation is correct 
##### TBD
- add in cycle boundaries for full cycle view
