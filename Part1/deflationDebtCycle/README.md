#### **Short-Term Debt Cycle**
- increased borrowing and spending = increased incomes and asset valuations 
- more collateral to borrow against = more lenders can lend 
- borrowing driving growth = affordable 
- central banks lowering interest rates elongates debt cycle 
    - raises asset prices = raises wealth 
    - lowers monthly payments on credit (keeps debt service burden down)
    - service payments >= amount debtors can borrow 
    - debt >= amount of money to service with 
- Deleveraging then begins 
- Add up to become **Long-Term Debt Cycle**

#### **Bull Market Kicks off the Bubble**
> -> justified due to low interest rates -> which increase asset prices -> that increase wealth -> and increases overall economic growth -> thus stronger balance sheets -> and abilty to take on more debt/lend -> increased confidence regarding the market -> spurs increasing leverage -> and new entrants to the market -> credit standards fall 
- *Shadow Banks* emerge, less regulated banking practices than peers. Offer new products into the market, largely unregulated. 
- Fast, easy money is made which provides collateral for new loans 
- Asset appears to be prosperous and **[long positions build up](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp)**
- Asset-Liability Mismatches Increase:
    - ST borrowing for LT lending 
    - liquid liabilities invested in illiquid assets 
    - investing in risky debt with borrowed money 
    - borrowing/lending across currencies
