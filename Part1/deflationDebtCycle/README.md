# **Classic Deflationary Debt Cycle:**
---
- Debt financed primarily in local currency -> Central bank able to print money in resolve 
- Debt service costs rising beyond economies ability to service 
- Deleveraging strategies put into place to safely and efficiently service debts neccessary to restabalize economy 

> ### **Policy Maker Levers:** 
> *to bring debt and debt service levels back in equilibrium*
> ##### Deflationary 
> 1. Austerity (spending less) 
> 2. Debt Defaults/Restructurings
> ##### Inflationary
> 3. Central Bank "Printing Money" or Making Purchases/Providing Garuntees 
> ##### Transfer of Wealth 
> 4. Money and Credit from the "Haves" to the "Have Nots" 

- Policy makers lower interest rates until they are so low they are no longer an effective tool 
- Print Money? Ofc! Easiest path with the least resistance to short term economy 
- Debt restructurings and austerity dominate - not balanced with economic stimulation

- Debt NOT growing faster than incomes
- Debt growth from financing interests that simultaneously increase incomes 
- **Sustainable Growth** while income growth can service growing debts

# 2. [Bubble](02_bubble.ipynb)

> - Debt Rising Faster Than Incomes (although incomes still rising)
> - Strong Asset Returns and Growth 
> - Borrower's Capacity Increasing, Success Elsewhere Encouraging Lenders to Lend 
> - Over-extrapolations of Justified Bull Markets 
#### **Short-Term Debt Cycle**
- increased borrowing and spending = increased incomes and asset valuations 
- more collateral to borrow against = more lenders can lend 
- borrowing driving growth = affordable 
- central banks lowering interest rates elongates debt cycle 
    - raises asset prices = raises wealth 
    - lowers monthly payments on credit (keeps debt service burden down)
    - service payments >= amount debtors can borrow 
    - debt >= amount of money to service with 
- Deleveraging then begins 
- Add up to become **Long-Term Debt Cycle**

#### **Bull Market Kicks off the Bubble**
> -> justified due to low interest rates -> which increase asset prices -> that increase wealth -> and increases overall economic growth -> thus stronger balance sheets -> and abilty to take on more debt/lend -> increased confidence regarding the market -> spurs increasing leverage -> and new entrants to the market -> credit standards fall 
- *Shadow Banks* emerge, less regulated banking practices than peers. Offer new products into the market, largely unregulated. 
- Fast, easy money is made which provides collateral for new loans 
- Asset appears to be prosperous and **[long positions build up](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp)**
- Asset-Liability Mismatches Increase:
    - ST borrowing for LT lending 
    - liquid liabilities invested in illiquid assets 
    - investing in risky debt with borrowed money 
    - borrowing/lending across currencies for a perceived 'spread'
- **Debts rise fast and debt service costs rise even faster**
- Consensus (rough idea of future) factored into market prices -> leads to extrapolation due to overweighted movements 
- *Increasing Debt-to-Income Ratios* 
- Leveraging up between ~20-25% of GDP in ~3 years
- Most vulnerable as bubble reaches the top

|Conditions During Bubble      | Change During Bubble | Range |
|------------------------------|----------------------|-------|
| **Debt Growing Faster than Incomes**     | **40%**  | **14%-79%** |
| Debt growing Rapidly                     | 32%      | 17%-45% |
| **Income Growth High, Slower than Debt** | **13%**  | **8%-20%** |
| Equity Markets Extend Rally              | 48%      | 22%-68% |
| **Yield Curve Flattens (SR - LR)**       | **1.4%** | **0.9%-1.7%** | 


> ### **Monetary Policy and Bubbles**
> - Central Bankers target inflation (and some growth), but don't target management of bubbles 
> - Policies often help inflate the bubble
> - Monetary Policy too broad to attack bubbles in specific sectors of the economy 
> - Central Bankers often sit back and watch until it becomes a "systemic threat" before enacting policies 
> ### **Identifying Bubbles**
> - Prices are High (relative to traditional measures)
> - Prices are Discounting Future Rapid Price Appreciation
> - Broad Bullish Sentiment 
> - High Leverage Purchases 
> - Buyers with Extended Forward Purchases (to speculate/protect against future price gains) 
> - New Market Entrants 
> - Stimulative Monetary Policy Continues to Inflate (tight policy would pop)

> ### **Long  |  Levered  |  Overpriced**
> #### Typically occur as Central Bank attempts to tighten policy and interest rates rise 
> ---
> #### Cycle: *Wealth Falls -> Income Falls -> Credit-Worthyness Weakens -> Lending Constricted -> Spending Drops -> Investments Fall -> Selling Out -> Less Appealing to Buy -> ...*

- Asset prices fall and create negative "wealth effects" 
- Riskiest investments begin to fall through the cracks
- Lenders raise standards and the credit spreads widen 
- Short rates rise and narrow the spread between long rates 
    - eliminating extra interest rate earned for lending long term rather than short term 
    - Yield curve flattens or inverts (Short Rates Higher than Long Rates)
- Holding cash becomes more attractive due to rising short term interest rates 
    - further raises interest rate used to discount the future cash flows -> weakening riskier asset prices and slowly lending 
    - items bought on credit are now more expensive 
- Short rates peak a few months prior to the top in the market 
- More leverage = bigger busts (takes less tighetning to burst the bubble)
- Downturn dependent on market sector -> overall market is too broad to measure as a whole what the damage will look like 
- Wealth effect of asset price movement has a bigger impact on economic growth rates than monetary policy
