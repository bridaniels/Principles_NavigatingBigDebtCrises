# **Classic Deflationary Debt Cycle:**
---
- Debt financed primarily in local currency -> Central bank able to print money in resolve 
- Debt service costs rising beyond economies ability to service 
- Deleveraging strategies put into place to safely and efficiently service debts neccessary to restabalize economy 

> ### **Policy Maker Levers:** 
> *to bring debt and debt service levels back in equilibrium*
> ##### Deflationary 
> 1. Austerity (spending less) 
> 2. Debt Defaults/Restructurings
> ##### Inflationary
> 3. Central Bank "Printing Money" or Making Purchases/Providing Garuntees 
> ##### Transfer of Wealth 
> 4. Money and Credit from the "Haves" to the "Have Nots" 

- Policy makers lower interest rates until they are so low they are no longer an effective tool 
- Print Money? Ofc! Easiest path with the least resistance to short term economy 
- Debt restructurings and austerity dominate - not balanced with economic stimulation

### Debt Rising Faster Than Incomes
### Bull Market -> Strong Asset Returns and Growth -> Increased Borrower/Lending Capacity -> Encouraging More Lending 
### *Shadow Banks* emerge with loosely/unregulated financial products 
### Stimulative Monetary Policy Continues Inflation 


#### **Short-Term Debt Cycle**
- increased borrowing and spending = increased incomes and asset valuations 
- more collateral to borrow against = more lenders can lend 
- borrowing driving growth = affordable 
- central banks lowering interest rates elongates debt cycle 
    - raises asset prices = raises wealth 
    - lowers monthly payments on credit (keeps debt service burden down)
    - service payments >= amount debtors can borrow 
    - debt >= amount of money to service with 
- Deleveraging then begins 
- Add up to become **Long-Term Debt Cycle**

> ### **Long  |  Levered  |  Overpriced**
> #### Occur when Central Bank attempts to tighten policy and interest rates rise 
> ---
> #### Cycle: *Wealth Falls -> Income Falls -> Credit-Worthyness Weakens -> Lending Constricted -> Spending Drops -> Investments Fall -> Selling Out -> Less Appealing to Buy -> ...*

- Wealth effect of asset price movement has a bigger impact on economic growth rates than monetary policy

# 4. Depression 
___

> ##### Risk-Free Interest Rates Can't Be Cut Further 
> - Either Already Close to 0, or at 0 
> - High Currency Outflows Raise the Floor of Interest-Rates Due to Credit/Currency Risk Considerations 
> - Wide Credit Spreads 
    - spread between high-risk borrowers IR and risk-free rate




> #### Deleveraging Dynamic: 
> - Driven by supply and demand of/relationships between **credit, money, goods, and services**
> - Psychology plays only a small roll
> - Debtor's debt is still too expensive for them to service relative to money coming in 
> #### Central Bank Prints: 
> - Money loses buying power 
> - Creditors receiving less buying power than originally anticipated 
> - Credit is not real money -> just a promise to pay in the future 
> - People discover most of their "wealth" was merely just credit 
>   - debtors unable to keep the promise, creditors wealth decreases 
>> #### Credit Contraction: 
>> income not sufficient to service debt -> assets to be sold to service debts -> asset prices drop -> reduces value of collateral -> reduces incomes -> reduces creditworthiness -> net worth and income falling faster than debt -> borrowers less creditworthy -> lenders less likely to lend (one persons debts are another person's assets)
## Well Managed Depressions: 
- Lower Interest Rates Quickly 
    - if lowering does not work, move to alternative stimulation
- Right mix of levers will reduce the duration of the depression and determine outcome
- Wary of **"Moral Hazard"**: party not entering into contract in good faith 
    - taxpayers angry that institutions excessive lending caused the crises and don't want them being bailed out 
    - policy makers to control amount of debt excess without *systemic risk* 
    - typically slow to provide government supports and debt contration pains escalate quickly 
- Ignorance and lack of authority are bigger problems than the debts themselves 
### **Austerity:** natural course of depression forces
- let the overlevered go down and take everyone involved with them 
- issue: doesn't bring debt and income back into balance 
### **Printing Money**: central bank deciding which depositors/lenders to protect from losses 
- determine who is "systemically important" and provide resources to that party 
- help institutions handle "runs" 











## 5. Beautiful Deleveraging 
## 6. Pushing on a String 
## 7. Normalization 

- mark-to-market accounting: fair value asset pricing for assets with constantly changing values (mark in book should reflect current market conditions)
