#### Short Term Debt Cycle
- increased borrowing and spending = increased incomes and asset valuations 
- more collateral to borrow against = more lenders can lend 
- borrowing driving growth = affordable 
- central banks lowering interest rates elongates debt cycle 
    - raises asset prices = raises wealth 
    - lowers monthly payments on credit (keeps debt service burden down)
    - service payments >= amount debtors can borrow 
    - debt >= amount of money to service with 
- Deleveraging then begins
